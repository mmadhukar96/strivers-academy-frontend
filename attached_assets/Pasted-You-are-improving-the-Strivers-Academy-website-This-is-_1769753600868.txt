You are improving the Strivers Academy website.
This is a global EdTech platform offering premium 1-to-1 live online STEM mentorship (Coding, Robotics, AI, 3D, AR/VR) for students aged 6–16.
The primary audience is international parents (US, UK, Middle East).
The goal is to strengthen clarity, trust, and conversion while keeping the existing design intact.

Apply this consistently across all pages.

3. ADD PARENT FAQ SECTION / PAGE

Is this 1-to-1 or group-based?

Are sessions live or recorded?

Who teaches the sessions?

Which countries do you serve?

What age group is this for?
